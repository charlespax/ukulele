I could fall in your eyes for a thousand years.

I don't know how our story ends. But I sure do want to read it.

Oh. Everybody want to know.
How this little story ends.
Like you can turn a page to peak ahead
We're trying to fight it 'cause we're still trying to write it.

Time. It seems like we're running out.
