The Velvet Underground - Pale Blue Eyes

F...F...
F..           .       F     ...
  Sometimes I feel so happy,
Bb..           .       F   ...
   Sometimes I feel so sad.
F..           .       Dm    ...
  Sometimes I feel so happy,
Bb.               C      .     F...
  Mostly you just make me  mad
Bb    .        C      .     F... F...
Baby, you just make me  mad

C...C...F...F...
Linger on your pale blue eyes
C...C...F...F...
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountaintop
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had, but couldn't keep
I've had, but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in a mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
Said "money is like us in time
It lies, but can't stand up"
Down for you is up

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good waht we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
