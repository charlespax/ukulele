        D                 G                 A   A
Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
       D          G                  A     A
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,
         G               D                G               D
Well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see,
  G              D              G               A  A
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
      D                 G                 D    D
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
 
 
          D                        G           A     A
Well, the room is crowded, there's people everywhere
      D                G           A      A
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
         G                 D               G                   D
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, I ll take that frown and break it, 
  G                  D            G                   A        A
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it,
      D                 G                 D   D
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
 
 
      D                G                  A   A
I can see that you are lonesome just like me,
       D                 G              A    A
and it being late, you'd like some company,
     G               D                G                D
Well I've had two, I look at you, and you look back at me,
    G                   D                 G                    A    A
The guy you're with has up and split, the chair next to you is free,
      D                   G                 D  D
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.
 

Interlude: D G A  D G A  G D G D  G D G A  

      D                 G                 D    D
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
 
 
        D                G               A    A
Now the night does funny things inside a man
          D               G              A     A
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
  G               D                G           D      
I turn around and look at you, you light a cigarette
  G              D                G               A
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
      D                 G                 D   D
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
 
 
         D                 G              A
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
     D                    G            A
Last call for drinks I'll have another stout
  G               D                   G             D
I turn around and look at you, you're nowhere to be found
  G                    D                 G                       A
I search the place for your lost face, I guess I'll have another round
      D                 G                 D
and I think that I just fell in love with you
